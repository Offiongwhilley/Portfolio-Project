        <h3>About the Game</h3>
        <p>The reason I came up with this fun and exciting game is to let the player work on his/her skills in guessing a random number with only having a limited knowledge and hints as to what the exact mystery number is. Guessing has already been a part of the human intellectual skill all throughout the ages and this game will test each of the playerâ€™s skill on to what technique and as to how will the player guess the mystery number.</p>
